## 📁 Projects

## 📌 Task Manager 2.1 (React + Flask + MySQL + Playwright)

- Fully deployed web application for task management with user registration, login, and CRUD operations.  
- Each user has their own account, and tasks are stored in a cloud database.  
- Frontend is deployed on Vercel, backend on Render, database hosted on Aiven.
- Complete E2E tests using **Playwright (Python)** to verify login, registration, and CRUD functionality in the frontend.

> ℹ️ **Note:** The backend runs on Render's free tier. After approximately 15 minutes of inactivity, it may go into sleep mode, which can cause a slight delay on the first request. The frontend (Vercel) remains constantly available.
